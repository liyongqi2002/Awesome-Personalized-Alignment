Personalized Alignment can be broadly categorized into two directions based on usage:

1. **Personalized Assistant**: This involves developing AI assistants that are better tailored to meet users' personalized needs and preferences.

2. **Intrinsic Personalization**: This focuses on enabling AI to exhibit personalized internal characteristics and personality traits, akin to role-playing. This approach is utilized in social simulations or the development of social agents.

Our current focus is primarily on the first direction, i.e., Personalized Assistant. For the latter, Intrinsic Personalization, we suggest exploring papers related to the role-playing or social agent studies of LLMs.
